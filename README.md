# Vuex Observable

![vuex-observable-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smirzo/vuex-observable-plugin/master/assets/vuex-observable-image.png)

A plugin that adapts the popular [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) middleware to Vuex.

_Please note that this plugin has not yet been battle tested in a production setting and should therefore be used with caution in a mission-critical environment._

## Installation

`npm i vuex-observable-plugin`

## Peer dependencies

`npm i rxjs@6.x.x`

_Your project should contain rxjs (version 6 or above) as redux-observable requires it as a peer dependency._

## Usage

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'
import { VuexObservable, ofType } from 'vuex-observable-plugin'

import { actions, mutations, state, getters, epics } from './store'

Vue.use(Vuex)

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  actions,
  mutations,
  state,
  getters,
  plugins: [VuexObservable(epics, { dependencies: { ofType } })],
})
```

## API

**VuexObservable(epics, options)**

The main function that creates the plugin instance.

- **epics**

  Description: An array containing all the [epics](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html).

  Type: `Array`

  Example: `[someEpic, someOtherEpic]`

- **options**

  Description: Options passed to the observable middleware (mostly used for dependency injection). More info about the options can be found [here](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/api/createEpicMiddleware.html).

  Type: `Object`

  Example: `{ dependencies: { http } }`

**ofType(actionType)**

A helper operator for filtering the action stream by specific action type(s).

- **actionType**

  Description: An action type string or an array of action type strings to filter the stream by. More info about this operator can be found [here](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/blob/master/docs/basics/Epics.md#a-basic-example).

  Type: `string | string[]`

  Example: `ofType('SOME_ACTION')`

## Differences between vuex-observable and redux-observable

This plugin aims to preserve the API of _redux-observable_ and therefore most of the documentation is compliant with what is shown in the [official redux-observable documentation](https://redux-observable.js.org/).

There are however a couple of differences to the original API due to the inherent architectural difference between _Vuex_ and _Redux_:

#### Epic's Outputs

By default, the epics receive an _action_ as input and return a _mutation_ as output. It is also possible to return an _action_ as output by simply specifying a third `action` parameter in the returned object. For example:

![epics-output](./assets/epics-output.png)

```js
;(action$, store$, { ofType, mapTo }) =>
  action$.pipe(
    ofType('SOME_ACTION'),
    mapTo({ type: 'SOME_MUTATION' }),
  )

// => Triggers the mutation 'SOME_MUATATION'
```

```js
;(action$, store$, { ofType, mapTo }) =>
  action$.pipe(
    ofType('SOME_ACTION'),
    mapTo({ type: 'SOME_OTHER_ACTION', action: true }),
  )

// => Triggers the action 'SOME_OTHER_ACTION'
```

#### Store stream

The second argument passed to the epic is not only an observable of the `state$` but the `store$`, which contains both the _state_ and _getters_. For instance:

```js
;(action$, store$, { ofType, map }) =>
  action$.pipe(
    ofType('SOME_ACTION'),
    map(payload => ({
      type: 'SOME_MUTATION',
      payload: store$.value.state.number * store$.value.getters['COMPUTED_NUMBER'] * payload,
    })),
  )
```

#### Dispatching actions vs epics

A dispatched action is either passed to an action or an epic, but never to both at the same time.<br/><br/>Whenever an action with the dispatched type is available, it will be passed to the standard Vuex action handler with the matching type name and it will not reach the epics. However, when an action with the dispacthed type has not been registered, it will be passed on to be handled by the root epic. <br/><br/>This is because both actions and epics are usually asynchronous and running them both in parallel could often result in race conditions and unpredictable behaviour that is hard to test.

## Important performance related notes

When the state gets very large (thousands of object) or if state mutations happen extremely often, then the store might start suffering in performance. This is due to the state mutability differences between _Vuex_ and _Redux_ (Vuex's state is mutable while Redux's is not).

The plugin must therefore check if the state has actually changed on every dispatched epic and mutation in order to conform to the _redux-observable_ api, which will expect a new object reference if the state has actually changed (so it can emit a new store stream event).

There could be ways to avoid this by editing the _redux-observable_ source itself, but that would mean forgoing all the automatic bug fixes, testing and updates _redux-observable_ already receives.

That being said, in most use cases this would never manifest as an issue.
